## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, Flexbox, media queries

### What I learned
While working on this project, I learned to create a responsive three column product card design with the help of HTML and CSS. I added some simple hover effects on the buttons and some media queries to make this design mobile-friendly. Since i already have some experience with the flexbox and other css properties, it was easy for me to create this mini project.
